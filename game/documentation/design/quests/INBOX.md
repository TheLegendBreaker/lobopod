## The good boy

A friend gives you a really easy lobopod:
	- love and give it new outfits.

## The sad boy

On of your lobopods tells you it is deeply un-happy.
	- asking it about its dreams leads you to boxing fame.
	- comforting it will make it eventually grow wings.
	- Asking about what makes it happy will lead to a rant about how its ancestors would dispise it.

## My pet dragon

You lobopod has grown so large and strong that it is terrorizing towns. 
You must:
	- destroy the destroyer
		- your attacks are ineffective, but the beast is so emotionally hurt that it leaves you. You spend the rest of your days worrying about it seeking revenge on you.
	- Tell the pleasent to leave
		- you and your pet have to destroy the world's poputlation to live in peace.
