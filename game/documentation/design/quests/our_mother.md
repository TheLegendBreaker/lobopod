I am the beginning of the universe. My tears started the chemical reactions that spurned the first cells into life. I brought forth the potential for consciousness.  

As I am the beginning, so must I carry the seed of the end. I am a mother, and I fear I will not live to see the faces of my brood. 

One of my children will be the beginning of the next universe. 

The other will be the end of the cycle, the end of the potential for consciousness.

I can only give you small clues as to which is which. Peering into the future has only hurt. 

The continuation of consciousness...

The one will turn the wheel of time when the third molt has sluffed off her to reveal a chrysalis whose hatching will bring about the next iteration of the universe.

On her third molt, the other will devour her sibling and the whole of existence one mouth full at a time. 

You must decide and destroy the end before she completes her third molt. there are rights and offerings that you can feed them that will prolong the time between molts, indefinitely as you need.
